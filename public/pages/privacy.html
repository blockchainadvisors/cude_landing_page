        Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information.</p>
    <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>You can use our services in many ways—to search for and share information, communicate with other people, or
        create new content. When you share information with us, for example, by creating a CODE SECURE LTD Account,
        we can make those services even better—to show you more relevant search results and ads, help you connect with
        people, or make sharing with others quicker and easier.</p>
    <h2>3. Information Use</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect from our services to provide, maintain, protect, and improve them, develop new
        ones, and protect CODE SECURE LTD and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content,
        such as more relevant search results and ads.</p>
    <h2>4. Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share personal information with companies, organisations, and individuals outside of CODE SECURE LTD unless one of the following circumstances applies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With your consent</li>
        <li>For external processing</li>
        <li>For legal reasons</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>5. Information Security</h2>
    <p>We work hard to protect CODE SECURE LTD and our users from unauthorised access to or unauthorised alteration,
        disclosure, or destruction of information we hold.</p>
    <h2>6. Changes</h2>
    <p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Without your explicit consent, we will not reduce your rights
        under this Privacy Policy.</p>
